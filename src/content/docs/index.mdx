## Technical Writer

5+ years in Technical Communication and 3+ years in Information Technology, specialized in enterprise software, API documentation, and information architecture. I design user and adnim guides, along with architecture resources that can grow with the organization.

I work directly within Product and Engineering teams during the incubation stage of production, using the development period as a form of peer review for the documentation. This level of integration allows me to influence development and product decisions while seamlessly working on the user experience alongside new resources.
